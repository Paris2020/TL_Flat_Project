						<h2>Book Description - The Curse of the Dream Witch</h2>
						
						<p>
						It is the age of the Great Dread. The Dream Witch wants the heart of 
						Princess Olivia. Until she has it none of the kingdom's children are safe. 
						Olivia's parents seek help from the Prince Leo of Pretonia and his uncle, the Duke of Fettwurst, 
						but the treacherous duo seize their castle instead. </p>
						
						<p>
						It is up to Olivia to defeat the Dream Witch, 
						Prince Leo and his uncle. She makes a daring escape from her turret cell and races to the forest to take on the 
						Dream Witch in her underground lair. Two friends are by her side: the peasant boy Milo and a curious 
						talking mouse with a surprising past. Together they must face danger and fantastical adverseries to lift 
						the Great Dread, save their families and resuce a kingdom.</p>
